# iq.com_m3u8_parser
Easily grab/parse and save m3u8 content to file.

I've included the bookmarklet version with icon already. Just import it into your chrome bookmark 

Note: 
1. for www.iq.com only. I haven't tried from iqyi.com
2. To get the 1080p, you should have VIP access.
3. before clicking the script or bookmarklet, set your desire resolution first and play the video to catch the m3u8 content.
